# 🛒 Day 9 — Voice E-Commerce Agent  
### Murf AI Voice Agents Challenge | Built with LiveKit Agents + Gemini + Deepgram + Murf Falcon

This project is my **Day 9 submission** for the **Murf AI Voice Agents Challenge**, where I built a fully functional **voice-driven e-commerce shopping assistant** inspired by the **Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP)**.

LYRA (the assistant) can browse products, search the catalog, place orders, store order history, and recall your last purchase — all through **natural conversations**.
